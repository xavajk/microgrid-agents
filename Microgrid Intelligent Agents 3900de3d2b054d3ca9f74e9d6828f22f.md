# Microgrid Intelligent Agents

# Introduction

Microgrid Intelligent Agents are software programs that are designed to control and monitor microgrids. Microgrids are small-scale power grids that can operate independently from the larger power grid. They are becoming more common as a way to increase energy resiliency and provide backup power during emergencies.

Intelligent agents can be used to optimize the operation of microgrids. They can monitor energy usage and production and adjust parameters in real-time to ensure that the microgrid is operating efficiently. They can also predict energy demand and adjust the microgrid's output accordingly.

Intelligent agents can be used to facilitate communication between different parts of the microgrid, such as between energy storage systems and power generators. This can help to ensure that the microgrid is operating at maximum efficiency and can respond quickly to changes in energy demand or supply.

## Microgrid Architectures

### [A Review of Existing Microgrid Architectures](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/je/2013/937614/)

Microgrid architectures refer to the different configurations and structures of microgrid systems. A microgrid is a localized network of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar panels, wind turbines, and energy storage systems, which can operate independently or connect to the main electrical grid.

There are several types of microgrid architectures, including:

1. Grid-Connected Microgrid: In this architecture, the microgrid is connected to the main electrical grid. It can import or export electricity from or to the grid based on the demand and availability of renewable energy resources.
2. Islanded Microgrid: In an islanded microgrid architecture, the microgrid operates in isolation from the main grid. It can generate and consume electricity independently without relying on the grid. This architecture is useful in remote areas or during grid outages.
3. Hybrid Microgrid: A hybrid microgrid combines both renewable energy sources and conventional sources, such as diesel generators. This architecture provides more flexibility and reliability by utilizing multiple energy sources.
4. AC/DC Microgrid: Microgrids can operate on either alternating current (AC) or direct current (DC) power systems. AC microgrids use AC power distribution, similar to the main grid, while DC microgrids use DC power distribution. The choice of AC or DC depends on the type of energy sources and loads in the microgrid.
5. Community Microgrid: A community microgrid is designed to serve a specific community or neighborhood. It can include shared energy resources, such as rooftop solar panels, battery storage systems, and electric vehicle charging stations, to provide energy independence and resilience to the community.

## MAS Architectures

### [A MAS Architecture for Microgrids](https://www.academia.edu/20353684/A_MAS_Architecture_for_Microgrids_Control)

The main idea behind the architecture is layered learning, where the controls and actions of the agents are grouped based on their effect on the environment.

The implementation of the agent in this architecture is based on the Jade platform, which provides a library for creating behaviors using a basic object called Behavior. The platform also offers a number of classes that extend the basic Behavior object. Additionally, JADE provides methods for manipulating these behaviors.

The MAS architecture for Microgrids control is organized into three main behaviors:

1. Market participation behavior: This behavior focuses on the participation of the Microgrid in the market. It handles the interactions and negotiations with external entities, such as the grid operator or other Microgrids.
2. Energy management behavior: This behavior is responsible for managing the energy resources within the Microgrid. It handles tasks such as load balancing, optimization of energy usage, and coordination of distributed generation.
3. Fault management behavior: This behavior deals with the detection and handling of faults or disruptions within the Microgrid. It includes tasks such as fault detection, isolation, and recovery.

These three behaviors, along with auxiliary behaviors for message handling and monitoring, form the main components of the MAS architecture for Microgrids control.

Overall, the architecture aims to provide a system capable of integrating multiple functionalities and to propose a general scheme for the control of Microgrids. The benefits of using MAS technology in the Microgrid control include adaptability to various configurations of the Microgrid, flexibility in adding or modifying components, and ease of programming and behavior implementation.
